Howdy! I appreciate that you'd like to know more about me. I'm a *veteran* officer of the Canadian Armed Forces, and I've worked in various marketing *leadership* roles for six years before launching my *web development* company, [Atomic Growth](https://atomicgrowth.co). I've had a passion for technology since I was young and taught myself programming and web development. 

I also founded Speedy Networking, where I help build business communities through different online business networking initiatives. Looking to network with like-minded individuals online? Check out [SpeedyNetworkingOnline.com](https://speedynetworkingonline.com).

I love to build projects with **Python**, **Django**, **Elixir**, **Wagtail**, and **Vue**. I'm always looking to learn new technologies, and I'm usually working on some side projects. 

I love contributing to open source, and I'm looking for the next project to support.

When I'm not coding, meeting clients, or writing -- I'm usually playing chess on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/register?ref_id=40117736), or flying around in a float plane.
