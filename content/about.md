Howdy! I apreaciate that you'd like to know more about me. I'm a *vetran* officer of the Canadian Armed Forces and I've worked in various marketing *leadership* roles for 6 years before launching my *web development* company, [Atomic Growth](https://atomicgrowth.co). I'm had a passion for technology since I was young, and taught myself programming and web development. 

I love to build projects with **Python**, **Django**, **Elixir**, **Hugo**, and **Vue**. I'm always looking to learn new technologies and I'm usualy working on some kind of side project. 

I love contributing to open source and I'm looking for the next project to support.

When I'm not coding, meeting clients, or writing -- I'm usualy plaing chess on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/register?ref_id=40117736), or flying around in a float plane.
